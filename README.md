Alright, buckle up, fellow software engineers! This article might sound like a series of wild tech horror stories, but it's actually a goldmine of insights for us in the software engineering (SWE) world.

First off, it's a reality check. It reminds us that what's considered normal in our industry can sometimes be utterly bonkers to the outside world. It's a wake-up call to question the status quo, and that's essential in SWE because our field is ever-evolving. What was normal yesterday might not cut it tomorrow.

The article also sheds light on the normalization of deviance, a concept we've probably all witnessed in our careers. You know, when a not-so-great practice becomes the norm, and we just roll with it. But this article screams at us to stop normalizing these issues. In SWE, that's crucial. We're in a field where mistakes can lead to catastrophic failures, and we can't afford to brush them under the rug.

Moreover, it emphasizes the importance of a strong engineering culture. It's not just about the latest coding techniques or tech stacks. It's about fostering a culture that values safety, efficiency, and continuous improvement. As SWEs, we know that a healthy culture is the bedrock of a successful project.

The article also highlights the need to pay attention to weak signals. Newcomers often spot problems that those of us who've been around the block might have become numb to. It's a reminder that diverse perspectives are invaluable in our field, and we should actively seek out these insights.

In a nutshell, this article is good for SWE because it challenges us to be better. It reminds us not to accept the bizarre as business as usual, to question deviant practices, and to strive for a culture that values excellence. It's a rallying cry for SWEs to keep our industry on the right track, learn from others' mistakes, and continuously improve our craft. So, fellow engineers, read this article, and let it inspire you to be the change you want to see in the tech world! ðŸš€
